task1
Print numbers with loop: Write a program that uses a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Code:
Print(“Write a program that uses a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.”)
i=1
while i<=10
          print(i)
          i+=1
task2
Calculate the sum of numbers: Write a function that calculate the sum of all numbers up to a given number using a loop
Code: 
Print(“Write a function that calculate the sum of all numbers up to a given number using a loop”)
def sum_up_to(n):
     total=0
     for i in range (1,n+1):
            total+=i
            return total
#Example usage:
result = sum_up_to(10)
print(result)
task3
Display a star pattern: Write code using loops and nested loops to create star pattern.
Code:
def pyramid_star_pattern(n):
  for i in range (n):
   for j in range (n-i-1):
   print(‘  ‘,  end=’ ‘)
for j in range (2 * i +1):
  print(‘ *’, end=’ ‘)
print()
#Example usage
pyramid_star_pattern(5) 
task4
Find even number in a list: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and prints only the even numbers.

Code:

Def print_even_numbers(numbers):
 For num in numbers:
  If num %2 = =0:
      Print(num)
#Exmple usage
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print_even_number(numbers)
